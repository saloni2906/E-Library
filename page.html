 <div class="CSE"> <p>1.(Digital Library; E-Library) A set of documents available through electronic means 
      by the use of digital technologies that allow for the retrieval, archiving, 
      preservation, and dissemination of those documents (Cf. Grand dictionnaire 
      terminologique). Learn more in: Constructing Virtual Libraries <br>2.An ordered 
      collection of heterogeneous electronic documents (including books) equipped with a 
      navigation and search tool. It can be a website where various texts are gradually 
      accumulated (more literary, but also any others up to computer programs) and media 
      files, each of which is self-sufficient and at any time can be in demand by the 
      reader. Electronic libraries can be universal, seeking to the widest choice of 
      material (as a library Moshkova or Librusk), and more specialized, as a fundamental 
      electronic. Learn more in: Digital Communication in the Inclusive Classroom <br>3.A
